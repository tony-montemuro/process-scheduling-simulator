# process-scheduling-simulator
My final project for the class Computer Science II: Data Structures. I completed this project during the Fall 2020 semester. 

In this project, we were asked to implement various data structures in order to create three CPU-Process Schedulers: 
1.) Round Robin Scheduler using an Array List
2.) Round Robin Scheduler using a Linked-List
3.) Completely Fair Scheduler using a Binary Search Tree

To simulate each scheduler, the program took 3 command-line arguments: 
1.) Number of CPU-Cycles
2.) Number of I/O-Bound Processes
3.) Number of CPU-Bound Processes

In order to see the specific instructions I was given, please read "Scheduling.pdf."

NOTE: Not every single line of code in this project is my own. Some of the header files were written by Dr. Josuha Booth. The author of each file is stated in the first few lines of each file.
